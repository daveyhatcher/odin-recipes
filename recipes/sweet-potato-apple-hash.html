    <ol>
        <li>The first step i making your Sweet Potato Apple Hash is to peel and chop the sweet potatoes.
            You'll also need to chop your apple and bacon into bite-sized pieces.
            To make this recipe vegetarian, leave out the bacon and use a tablespoon of olive oil instead.
            Please see the printable recipe card at the end of this post for the exact ingredients and measurements</li>
        <li>Chopping the ingredients for this recipe is the hardest part. You do want to make sure the sweet potato
            apple are chopped fairly small so that they will cook fast. Once you're ready to make the hash, heat up
            a large skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and let it start to cook for about 2-3 minutes so it 
            starts to release its grease.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped sweet potatoes, apples, shallots or onion, and the fresh rosemary to the skillet.
            Cover the skillet with a lid and let the mixture cook for 10 minutes on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once the sweet potato and apple mixture has started to soften, reduce the heat to low and break the eggs
            on top of the hash. Cover the skillet again and let the eggs cook for about 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and serve the hash with salt and pepper on top. Store any leftovers in a tightly sealed
            container for up to 4 days. Reheat before serving.</li>
    </ol>
